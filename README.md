# cruddl-graphql-modules-tests

Run `pnpm test1` (or npm run / yarn) to run the scenario and watch console outputs. to see objects. I have also included reference objecs of a simple hello => world graphql query

The file `test-1-createModuleOfCruddlSchema.ts` has all the logic.
The cruddl sdl and the hello-module are in external files to keep clutter in the code to a minimum.
